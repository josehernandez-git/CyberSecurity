9. Wireless Networking

9.1 Wireless Characteristics
Wireless networking involves transmitting data over radio waves without the use of physical cables. Key characteristics include:
- Mobility: Allows users to move freely while maintaining network connectivity.
- Range: The distance over which a wireless signal can effectively transmit data, influenced by factors like frequency, power, and environmental obstacles.
- Bandwidth: The maximum rate of data transfer across a given path.
- Interference: Wireless signals can be disrupted by other electronic devices, physical obstacles, and atmospheric conditions.
- Security: Wireless networks are more susceptible to unauthorized access and eavesdropping compared to wired networks.

9.2 WLAN Standards
Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) standards define the protocols and technologies used for wireless networking. Common WLAN standards include:
- IEEE 802.11a: Operates in the 5 GHz band, supports up to 54 Mbps.
- IEEE 802.11b: Operates in the 2.4 GHz band, supports up to 11 Mbps.
- IEEE 802.11g: Operates in the 2.4 GHz band, supports up to 54 Mbps.
- IEEE 802.11n: Operates in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, supports up to 600 Mbps.
- IEEE 802.11ac: Operates in the 5 GHz band, supports up to 1 Gbps or more.
- IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6): Operates in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, supports up to 10 Gbps, improved efficiency and capacity.

9.3 Wireless Network Design
Designing a wireless network involves considering factors such as coverage area, capacity, performance, and security. Key steps include:
- Site Survey: Assess the physical environment to determine optimal placement of access points (APs) and identify potential sources of interference.
- Access Point Placement: Strategically position APs to provide adequate coverage and minimize dead zones.
- Channel Selection: Choose appropriate channels to minimize interference and overlap.
- Security Implementation: Deploy security measures like WPA3, strong passwords, and network segmentation.
- Network Management: Implement tools for monitoring, managing, and optimizing the wireless network.

9.4 WLAN Attacks
WLANs are susceptible to various security attacks, including:
- Eavesdropping: Intercepting wireless communications to gain unauthorized access to data.
- Rogue Access Points: Unauthorized APs set up to capture network traffic or provide malicious access.
- Denial of Service (DoS): Overloading the network with traffic to disrupt normal operation.
- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM): Intercepting and altering communication between devices.
- Replay Attacks: Capturing and retransmitting legitimate data packets to create unauthorized effects.

9.5 WLAN Security
Securing a WLAN involves implementing measures to protect against unauthorized access and attacks. Key security practices include:
- Encryption: Use strong encryption protocols like WPA3 to protect data.
- Authentication: Implement robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identities.
- Network Segmentation: Divide the network into segments to isolate sensitive data and systems.
- Regular Updates: Keep firmware and software up to date to patch vulnerabilities.
- Monitoring: Continuously monitor the network for suspicious activity and respond to security incidents promptly.
